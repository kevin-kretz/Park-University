# CS219 Programming Fundamentals
This is a class from my summer 2019 semester at Park University.  In each unit, I include the pdf file for the assignment instructions, as well as the submitted project.  If the instructor left me any comments about corrections being needed, I then corrected and pushed the update.  Unfortunately, I didn't think about uploading these projects until after the semester was over, so I cannot show my full work.
