# CS152 Introduction to Python Programming

This is a class from my summer 2019 semester at Park University. In each unit, I include the assignment instructions, as well as the submitted project. If the instructor left me any comments about corrections being needed, I then corrected and pushed the update. Unfortunately, I didn't think about uploading these projects until after the semester was over, so I cannot show my full work.

## Learning Objectives
1. Implement a Python program that uses iteration, branching and function calling based on a written problem description.
1. Analyze a Python program to determine syntax, runtime, and logic errors.
1. Implement Python functions with parameters.
1. Use collections such as lists, strings, tuples and dictionaries in a Python program.
1. Access text files for input and output.
