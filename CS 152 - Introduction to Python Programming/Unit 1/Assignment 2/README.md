# Introduction
This assignment lets you practice with writing a program that accepts user input and performs some simple calculations.

## Directions
Write a program:

Create a Python program that prompts the user to enter a number of yards, and then calculates the number of miles and yards, as well as the number of feet, and then prints the results.

## Notes
There are 3 feet in a yard and 1760 yards in a mile. Your program must declare and use several variables, like for the number of miles and number of feet. You should choose appropriate names based on your reading.

Your output should look like the examples. Be sure to print text and numbers without extra spaces.

### Example 1
```
Enter a positive number of yards:  3000

You entered 3000 yards, which is:
1 miles and 1240 yards
or
9000 feet
```
### Example 2
```
Enter a positive number of yards: 12

You entered 12 yards, which is:
0 miles and 12 yards
or
36 feet
```
