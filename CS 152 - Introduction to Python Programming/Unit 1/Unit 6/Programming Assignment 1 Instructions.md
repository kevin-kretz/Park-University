# Introduction
This assignment lets you practice reading data from a file.

## Preparation
This assignment must be done in a standalone Python environment, not the textbook. See the Textbooks and Materials page for instructions on installing the compiler on your local computer or using Parkâ€™s virtual desktop.

Download the data file [CityStateData.txt](./CityStateData.txt). This is the same set of data that you used in the previous assignment, but stored in a text file instead. Put this text file in the same folder as your Python program.

## Directions
1. Rewrite your program from Unit 5 so that it reads myCities from a file instead of defining all the data as part of your program itself. 

  *The file aspect should be the only thing that you change - the rest of the program logic should remain the same.*

2. Add your two test cases from the program in Unit 5.
3. Add two more cities of your own at the end of the text file.

  *You can edit the text file with Notepad, or IDLE, or any text editor on your system.*
