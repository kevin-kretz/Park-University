# Introduction
This assignment lets you practice with writing a simple program to make some art.

## Directions
1. Visit the site:  [It's a small, small, ...ASCII !](http://www.oocities.org/spunk1111/small.htm) (Links to an external site) to get some ideas for a small shape to draw. If that site is unavailable, then search through https://www.asciiart.eu/food-and-drinks (Links to an external site.) (there are many other sections, but you’ll have to search for a small enough shape to work with).
2. Print a shape:
    1. Use multiple print statements to create an interesting shape. Your shape should be at least two lines, with each print statement printing exactly one line of the shape. Here is an example:
    ```python
    print ("***")
    print (" **")
    print ("  *")
    ```

    Do **not** use a multiline string, like what is below:
    ```python
    print ("""\
    ***
    **
    *
    """)
    ```
    Be aware that there are some shapes that you might not be able to create easily. If something doesn’t work, then pick a different shape.

    2. Print a second copy of your shape below the first one. This shouldn’t be hard.
    3. Print two copies of your shape that are horizontally adjacent. This may take some experimentation.
    
## Example
If your original shape is a slice of bread, then the output of your program would look like this:
