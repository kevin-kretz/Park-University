# CS 225 - Programming Concepts
## Learning Objectives
1. Given a problem description, implement a C++ program that uses inheritance and operator overloading.
1. Implement functions with call-by-value, call-by-reference, and default parameters.
1. Use pointers, references, and both 1- and 2-dimensional arrays.
1. Compare C-style arrays of characters with C++ strings.
1. Analyze a C++ program to find syntax and logic errors.

### Unit 1 - Basics, Input/Output, Control Structures
* Create programs with stream input/output for both console and text files.
* Create programs using control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

### Unit 2 - Functions
* Create programs that require the use of programmer-defined functions.
* Select pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, or pass-by pointer for a function parameter.
* Construct generic code with C++ templates.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.
