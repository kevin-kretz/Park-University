# CS 225 - Programming Concepts
## Course Learning Objectives
* Given a problem description, implement a C++ program that uses inheritance and operator overloading.
* Implement functions with call-by-value, call-by-reference, and default parameters.
* Use pointers, references, and both 1- and 2-dimensional arrays.
* Compare C-style arrays of characters with C++ strings.
* Analyze a C++ program to find syntax and logic errors.

## Unit 1 - Basics, Input/Output, Control Structures
* Create programs with stream input/output for both console and text files.
* Create programs using control structures (if-else, switch, loops)
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

## Unit 2 - Functions
* Create programs that require the use of programmer-defined functions.
* Select pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, or pass-by pointer for a function parameter.
* Construct generic code with C++ templates.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

## Unit 3 - Arrays and Strings
* Create programs that require the processing of elements of one or multiple arrays or container objects.
* Contrast C-string and C++ string class.
* Construct programs that use C-string or C++ string class.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

## Unit 4 - Struct and Pointer
* Select pass-by-value, pass-by-reference, or pass-by pointer for a function parameter.
* Construct programs using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
* Compare C language structs with C++ classes.
* Create programs that use C language structs.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

## Unit 5 - OOP and Operator Overloading
* Create classes including the use of overloaded functions/operators, and constructors.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

## Unit 6 - Classes with Dynamic Data and Class Templates
* Construct generic code with C++ templates.
* Create programs that require the processing of elements of one or multiple arrays or container objects.
* Construct programs using pointers and dynamic memory allocation.
* Create classes including the use of overloaded functions/operators, and constructors.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.

## Unit 7 - Inheritance and Polymorphism
* Compare the three types of inheritance: public, protected, private.
* Create a hierarchy of classes based on inheritance and polymorphism.
* Analyze the syntax and execution of C++ programs.
