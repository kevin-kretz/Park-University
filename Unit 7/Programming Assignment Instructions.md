# Introduction
This assignment lets you practice with reading from a file, writing to a file, and using dictionaries.

## Preparation
This assignment must be done in a standalone Python environment, not the textbook. See the Textbooks and Materials page for instructions on installing the compiler on your local computer or using Parkâ€™s virtual desktop.

Download the data file [state_crime.csv](./state_crime.csv). This data file contains records of different types of reported crimes. The first line of the file contains a description of each column of data.

## Directions
Write a python program to read the file, and produce a summary of the total reported crimes for each state. The report will look something like this, though don't worry if your list is not in alphabetical order:
```
State            Reported Crimes      
Alabama                8,133,055
Alaska                 1,198,047
...
Wyoming                  834,588
United States        563,841,249
```

There are a lot of fields in the data file, but you can simplify your life by using subtotal fields, `Totals.Property.All` and `Totals.Violent.All`.

Once you  have the summary, change your program so it writes the summary to a file, `crime_summary.txt`.

Make sure you use a dictionary for this assignment. The obvious case is to use a key of state names and the value is the accumulated count of reported crimes. There might be a place for another dictionary as well, though you only need to use one.

Be sure to add a header comment to your program and any functions, and appropriate comments before other blocks of code.
