# Introduction
This assignment lets you practice with turtle graphics and loops.

## Preparation
For this assignment, you will need to submit a file to Canvas. If you are using a compiler on your own computer, you will already have the program in a file. If you are still using the textbook to write your programs, you will have to copy your program from the textbook ActiveCode window, and paste it into a text file. Be sure the file ends with a ‘.py’ extension. If you need help doing this, ask in the Instructor’s Office. Don’t wait until Sunday night to figure out how to do this.

## Directions
Write a python program with the following components:

1. Use your closed shape from the discussions. Modify your program to draw at least four of the same shape. Each shape must be visible, so you have to turn or move the turtle after you finish drawing each shape. For example, if you draw the same square four times in exactly the same place, there is no way to tell you drew four different squares.
2. Use at least one for loop in your program. You may use more if you like, and I encourage you to, but only one is required.
3. Write appropriate comments right before your shape, and anywhere else you think is appropriate.
4. Write a header comment with your name, date, and brief description of the program.
5. If you use a value more than once, like alex.forward (150), then be sure to assign a value to the variable and then use the variable instead:
```python
side = 150

alex.forward(side)
```
