# CS219 Programming Fundamentals

This is a class from my summer 2019 semester at Park University. In each unit, I include the pdf file for the assignment instructions, as well as the submitted project. If the instructor left me any comments about corrections being needed, I then corrected and pushed the update. Unfortunately, I didn't think about uploading these projects until after the semester was over, so I cannot show my full work.

## Course Objectives:
1. Given a problem description, implement a Java program that uses inheritance and polymorphism.
1. Use arrays (1 and 2 dimensional) and ArrayLists to store and manipulate collections of data.
1. Compare methods to solve searching and sorting problems.
1. Analyze a Java program to find syntax and logic errors.
