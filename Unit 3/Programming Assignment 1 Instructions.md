# Introduction
This assignment lets you practice with using random values in your program.

## Directions
Address any shortcomings in your Unit 2 assignment. Read the instructor comments and make the adjustments.
Use at least two different random numbers using randrange() or randint(). Depending on your program, it could be a random starting location for each shape, where the random numbers represent the (x,y) starting location, or it could be a random length of one side of a polygon. You may also want to experiment with randomly choosing an item from a list, using choice(), but you still need to use randrange() or randint() correctly as well. If you change the location, look at using the goto() function, but remember it really needs two parameters.
Add some functionality to your program by using two new turtle functions from the turtle module. You might want to change the turtle's shape, or the speed at which it moves, or the background color, etc. This is up to you. The reason for doing this is so you get used to reading documentation and using it.
