        <p>According to the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/" target="_blank">Britannica Encyclopedia</a>, artificial intelligence (<abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr>) is defined as:</p>
        <figure>
          <blockquote cite="https://www.britannica.com/technology/artificial-intelligence">
              <p>"The ability of a digital computer or computer-controlled robot to perform tasks commonly associated with intelligent beings."</p>

      <p>In the field of technology, <abbr title="artificial intelligence">AI</abbr> is a very popular topic of conversation.  For a long time, scientists have discussed whether or not AI would be able to take over the world (or prevent us from turning it off at least).  AI is being used all around us.  a few examples include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>video games</li>
        <li>mobile phone assistant</li>
        <li>red light cameras</li>
        <li>advertising algorithms</li>
        <li>website and data analytics</li>
      </ul>

        <p>AI has been incredibly powerful for a long time.  In 1956, an artificial intelligence chess robot called <abbr title="Mathematical Analyzer Numerical Integrator and Automatic Computer Model I">MANIAC I</abbr> defeated a novice chess player for the first time in world history.  This is a crucial point in history, because after that point, computers were then truly considered to be competitors in the chess world and proved to be capable of just about anything humans can do if programmed correctly.  With today's technology, the best chess players in the world struggle to compete with AI.  In <a href="https://www.chess.com/news/view/smerdon-beats-komodo-5-1-with-knight-odds" target="_blank">a recent match</a> between <abbr title="Grand Master - The highest title awarded to chess players">GM</abbr> David Smerdon and an AI "Komodo", GM David Smerdon was given a handicap by taking one of the AI's pieces and setting the time limit of the match to 1 minute per player (limiting the number of moves the AI could compute).  With this handicap, GM Smerdon still lost the first of the 6 games played.  All of this to say, computer are extremely intelligent and pose a threat of outsmarting us in just about any topic.</p>

        <p>AI today is being used all over, not just our world, but in our universe.  One of the biggest accomplishments of 2021 happened on February 18, when NASA's Perseverance Rover landed on Mars solely using AI.  Because it takes 7 minutes to get to Mars at the speed of light, providing any form of human input is basically impossible.  </p>
