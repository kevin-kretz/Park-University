        <h2>The Future</h2>
        <p>The future is always a world of unknowns, but with the way technology is advancing, wearble device will gain even more traction.  Smart glasses and augmented reality will be very benificial in the education industry and so will all kinds of health trackers.  Even further into the future, some believe that wearable technology will become obsolete.  Not because we won't want or use them, but because we will no longer be wearing them.  It is assumed that the next step in the technology is to have things like health trackers embedded inside of us!  It could be very rewarding, escpecially with health, being able to quickly diagnose and treat illnesses with these trackers; however, I am sure not everyone will be on board with this idea.  We are already starting to see some of this today!  There are now patches for people with daibetes that are placed in your arm and connect with your phone so you no longer need to prick your finger to get measurements.</p>
