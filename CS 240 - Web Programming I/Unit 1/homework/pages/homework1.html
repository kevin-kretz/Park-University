    <h1>Cloud Computing</h1>
    <h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>
    <p>Accoring to Microsoft, cloud computing is the delivery of computing services-including servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, and intelligence-over the Internet ("the cloud") to offer faster innovation, flexible resources, and economies of scale.<sup><a href="#reference-1">1</a></sup>  Most people have actually already used cloud computing, whether they know it or not.  The most common type of cloud computing used by the average user is storage.  Services like Microsoft OneDrive, which is built into Windows 10, and Google Drive have now been established as household names.  Although they may not be fully understood, most people see the benifits of saving all of their files to the cloud to make sure they are safely backed up.  Businesses now have full departments using all sorts of cloud computing services.  They might have a analytics department to determine how their website it used by their customers and artificial intellegence to improve on their current marketing techniques.  They can store all of their information in a dababase, as well as create their own software online in order to interact with these databases.  Cloud computing is already a huge market and will only become a bigger part of our lives.</p>
