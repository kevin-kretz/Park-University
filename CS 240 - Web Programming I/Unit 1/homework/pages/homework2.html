      <h2>Who is Docker?</h2>
      <p><a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> is a company that helps developers by speeding up the development process and simplifying it in the process. Docker as a company was founded in 2008, and on March 20, 2013 they released their first version to the public.  With over 7.3 million accounts and lots of big companies already using docker, it is surely only going to continue to grow.  Docker is going to be a vital skill to know in any software engineer's future.  If you haven't already, now is a great chance to learn more.</p>

      <h2>What is a container?</h2>
      <p>A container is a "standard unit of software" that bundles all of the necessary code and dependencies together in order to make the application run quicker and more efficiently.  One of the biggest features is that the application you build will run the same, no matter which machine or operating system your customer is using.  By doing this, you no longer need to make separate software for Windows, Mac or Linux environments.  It all just works, saving you a bunch of time, and allowing you to put more time into your final product.</p>
